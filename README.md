What is the problem?
A consumer bank with a range of products would like to cross-sell the personal protection insurance (PPI) product to those customers who have a secured or unsecured type of loan, but no PPI product yet.

The bank would like to adopt analytics driven approach applied on this sample data for deciding:
Who should they target from the pool of customers that currently do not have a PPI, and 
What type of PPI product they should be targeting them with.
